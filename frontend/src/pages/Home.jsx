                I'm Jesse Stahl, a skilled and dedicated front-end developer with a passion for creating interesting projects with a perfect 
                user experience. I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, staying up-to-date with the latest frameworks and 
                technologies such as React, and I take pride in writing clean, well-structured code that not only meets the project 
                requirements but also ensures maintainability and scalability.
                </p>

                <p>
                Having worked on various projects, I am proficient in translating design concepts into pixel-perfect websites, ensuring a 
                seamless user interface and optimal performance across different devices and browsers. I am well-versed in implementing 
                accessibility standards, ensuring that everyone can access and use the applications I develop.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                After being my own boss for three years, I am self-motivated, detail-oriented, and possess a strong problem-solving mindset. 
                I am comfortable working independently, managing my time effectively, and delivering high-quality work.
                My past employments as a truck driver and a line cook have taught me how to work well in a team setting, getting time-sensitive
                items done while collaborating with others.
